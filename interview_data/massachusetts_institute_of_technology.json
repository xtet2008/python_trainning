        "From the Institution": "The essence of MIT is our appetite for problems--especially those big, intractable, complicated problems whose solutions make a permanent difference. While MIT is a research university committed to world-class inquiry in math, science, and engineering, MIT has equally distinguished programs in architecture, the humanities, management, and the social sciences. A diverse, supportive campus environment--with an incredible range of student groups and athletic and fitness opportunities--ensures that it's not all about the work. And in MIT's intensely creative atmosphere, the arts flourish in all their forms."
